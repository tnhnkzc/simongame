# simongame
Simon game challenge is made to practice Java Script and jQuery.
Logic of the game is that, it shows you the first color, you choose the chosen color, then it will show you a new color and you have to choose the first color that was showed and the new color. So it makes a sequence and you have to remember all the previous colors as you advance in the game.
